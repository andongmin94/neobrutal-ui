description: Configure the registry and add neobrutal-ui source files with the shadcn CLI.
---

## Requirements

Use a React project with Tailwind CSS v4. You also need a `components.json` file for the
shadcn CLI.

## 1. Initialize shadcn

Current shadcn projects use Base UI by default. If the CLI asks you to choose a component
library, select Base UI.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

## 2. Configure the registry namespace

Add the neobrutal-ui registry to `components.json`. The CLI replaces `{name}` with the item
you request.

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@neobrutal-ui": "https://neobrutal-ui.andongmin.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

The namespace is configured manually until `@neobrutal-ui` is accepted into the official
shadcn registry directory.

## 3. Inspect the base item

Review the files, dependencies, and theme variables before installation.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest view @neobrutal-ui/neobrutal-ui
```

## 4. Add the base item

Install the base item once per project. It adds the shared CSS variables, Tailwind theme
mapping, aliases, and dependencies used by the components.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @neobrutal-ui/neobrutal-ui
```

## 5. Install components

Install the component you need from the registry.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @neobrutal-ui/button
```

You can install several items in one command.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @neobrutal-ui/button @neobrutal-ui/dialog
```

Component pages include a direct install command and the source preview. Registry items also
declare their npm and registry dependencies, so the CLI can resolve them with the component.

## Direct URL install

The namespace is optional. A registry item can also be installed from its production URL.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://neobrutal-ui.andongmin.com/r/button.json
```

## Manual install

You can copy source files manually, but install or reproduce the base item first so the
design tokens and Tailwind theme mapping exist in your project.

## Updating installed source

Registry items are copied into your repository, so updates are never applied silently. Preview
the current registry version before replacing a customized file.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @neobrutal-ui/button --dry-run
```

Use `--diff` to inspect a file-level change. When you have reviewed or backed up local edits,
run the command again with `--overwrite`.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @neobrutal-ui/button --overwrite
```

description: What neobrutal-ui provides, how it works, and where the project comes from.
---

neobrutal-ui is a source-owned component registry for building neobrutalist React interfaces.
It combines accessible behavior from [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/react) with Tailwind CSS
styling and the [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) distribution model.

## What you get

- React 19 components built on Base UI primitives where accessible behavior is required.
- Tailwind CSS v4 tokens for color, type, borders, radii, and hard shadows.
- shadcn registry items that copy editable source code into your application.
- Charts, decorative stars, and focused starter templates that use the same design system.

## How it works

This is not a runtime component package. The shadcn CLI downloads the selected source files,
installs their dependencies, and places the code in your project. You can inspect and edit
everything you install.

directory or inspect how the <Link href="/docs/registry">registry</Link> is organized.

## Project lineage

neobrutal-ui is a maintained remake of [ekmas/neobrutalism-components](https://github.com/ekmas/neobrutalism-components).
The current project separates the registry from the documentation, migrates interactive primitives
to Base UI, and maintains its own templates, examples, and documentation. See
[Credits & license](/docs/credits) for attribution details.
